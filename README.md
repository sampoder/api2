## Reasoning

Our [previous API](https://github.com/hackclub/api/blob/master/README.md) was really good at a couple things. It hasn't been touched in years and it's still providing password-less authentication as a service at scale.

Hack Club (HQ & community) needs a service for easily reading & writing information that will last the test of time the same way our original API still handles authentication. Airbridge will create this by providing a JSON interface to an Airtable backend.
